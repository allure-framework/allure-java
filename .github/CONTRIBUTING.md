## Contributing 

We love pull requests from everyone. 

Fork, then clone the repo:

```bash

```

Then build the project (build requires JDK 1.8 or higher):

```bash

```

Make your change. Add tests for your change. Make sure all the tests pass:

```bash
$ ./gradlew test
```

Push your fork and submit a pull request.
